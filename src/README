Implementation of a MMO-style game using OOP Concepts

Game logic in code:
-> Main class used for the initialization of the input data and ending the game
   -> Before the game runs it sorts the players so that the wizards will be at the end
      of the array
   -> After the game finishes it sorts back the players so that the heroes will be in the
      initial order
-> GameLoader class used for the file reading process of the input data and writing the output
   -> Used the FileIO API
-> GameInput class used to keep the necessary information of a game and to run the game

Important classes used:
-> Package main
   -> Main -> Used to adapt the input data to the game

-> Package input
   -> GameInput -> Used to store the information from a game
                -> Contains a method to run the game
   -> GameLoader -> Used to read and write the input and output data for a game
                 -> Contains methods to load and end the game

-> Package utils
   -> Position -> Used to store two-dimensional coordinates
               -> Contains equals method in order to compare two coordinates
   -> Constants -> Various constants used in the code

-> Package moves
   -> Interface Move -> Extended classes need to be visitable in order to apply the moves
      -> Extended different types of moves
   -> MoveFactory -> Factory pattern in order to get a move of the wanted type

-> Package sites
   -> Interface Site -> Extended classes need to be visitable in order to apply the site amplifiers
      -> Extended different types of sites
      -> Method to check the critical strike and extended rounds from the rogue hero
   -> SiteFactory -> Factory pattern in order to get a site of the wanted type

-> Package abilities
   -> Abstract class Ability -> Extended classes need to be visitable in order to apply the race amplifiers
      -> Contains fields for the basic damage types - damage and overtime damage
      -> Extended different types of abilities
      -> Each ability has its own stats
   -> Methods to update the abilities and apply the damage to a hero

-> Package heroes
   -> Abstract class Hero -> Extended classes need to have visitors in order to apply the movement and the amplifiers
      -> Contains fields for the stats without the abilities
      -> Extended different types of heroes with different abilities
      -> Each hero has its own stats
   -> Methods to level up, fight, update the stats for a hero, get the hero type and overridden toString method
      -> toString method used for the output format
   -> HeroComparator -> Comparator class in order to keep the wizards at the end of the array
   -> HeroIdComparator -> Comparator class in order to keep the heroes in the initial order from the input
   -> HeroFactory -> Factory pattern in order to get a hero of the wanted type
